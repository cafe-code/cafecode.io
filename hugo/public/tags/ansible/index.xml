      <description>The Gist Ansible has built-in &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about your hosts that make it easy to find basic information such as hostname, operating system, IP address. This is great for debugging or inventorying systems, however OS version is not included and it was surprisingly difficult to find a way to print this information out. I understand that Ansible is OS-independant (and hence OS-version-independant), however, it can be useful to know which servers are running CentOS/RH 6 vs 7.</description>

      <description>Background I am responsible for a few dozen linux servers at work, and although there was an effort to install Salt a few years ago, they are all managed individually and manually. I spend more time than I should ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into boxes to add users. install applications, or restart services. I looked into Puppet a few months ago, but it seemed to complicated and clunky for my environment. Specialty, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install and troubleshoot the client on dozens of serveres.</description>
